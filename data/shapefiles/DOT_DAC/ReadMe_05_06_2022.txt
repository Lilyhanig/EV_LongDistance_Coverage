The OverallDis field was used to display DOT Census tract disadvantage status. 

As part of DOT’s work in implementing the Justice40 Initiative, the Department developed a definition for disadvantaged communities (“DACs”) to be utilized in connection with certain criteria under Justice40-covered grant programs. In order to help grant applicants determine whether the locations of their proposed projects were in a DAC, the Department created an interim mapping tool which went live on January 28, 2022. The Department subsequently conducted a data audit and found that the mapping tool had data errors affecting approximately 11% of U.S. Census tracts. As of May 6, 2022, the DAC designations in the mapping tool are correct and available for public use in connection with Justice40-covered programs. The Department has also inventoried grant applications which have open notices of funding opportunity that referred to this tool and is contacting program applicants directly to notify them of this update and will assist with any corrections needed to their applications. 
Other users of this data may wish to revisit the site and update any analyses based on the mapping tool.  The Department apologizes for any inconvenience or confusion this error has caused.
